        <img class="project-img" src="css/images/You-lose.png" alt="You Lose">
        <p>Battle for the Realm was the first project I worked on. It is the card game War, where you and an opponent
          flip cards to see who has the higher card and wins the battle. Once one player has won the majority of the
          hands, the game is over.</p>

        <img class="project-img" src="css/images/Recipe page.png" alt="recipe page">
        <p>The Community Cookbook was an idea I had for my second project. I built an app where users could come
          together and share all of their favorite recipes, as well as seeing what recipes other users have added.
          There
          are multiple categories to choose from including breakfast, soups/salads, one pot meals, and more.</p>

        <img class="project-img" src="css/images/Youtorial tutorial page.png" alt="tutorial page">
        <p>Youtorial was the third project I worked on at GA. This was a group project that we built using
          Python/Django. Youtorial is a user generated tutorial site. Users are able to create tutorials on one of the
          current categories or create their own new one. The tutorials can be written instructions, a video, or both.
          Users are able to save tutorials they like to be completed later and they can rate the quality of the
          tutorials. Once finished, they go into the completed tutorials section on their profile page.</p>

        <img class="project-img" src="css/images/resultspage.png" alt="results page">
        <p>What Do You Know? was my final project at GA. It is a trivia app I made using React.js and the OpenTrivia
          API. You can select trivia from a number of different categories and difficulty, as well as selecting the
          number of questions to answer. Once finished, you will see how many questions you answered correctly or
          incorrectly, as well as the answers. It keeps a running total of your lifetime correct and incorrect
          answers.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm a recent graduate of the Software Engineering Immersive Program at General Assembly. Throughout the 450+
        hours of classes, assignments, and projects, I have developed my programming skills. I have experience working
        with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.</p>
      <p>Prior to attending the SEI program, I had been working for PSAV in the corporate AV industry. I started with
        PSAV in 2010 as an entry level technician, responsible for setting/striking equipment, teching events, and
        working with clients on-site. In 2017, I was promoted to Director of Event Technology and opened the brand new
        Hotel Born in downton Denver. I was integral in setting up various processes including billing, client
        introductions, AV sales process, SOP for room sets, and much more. Over my two years at the Born, I grew the
        property from $400k/yr in AV revenue to nearly $1mil/yr. I also maintained an average Guest Satisfaction
        Survey
        score of 9.6.</p>
